<h2> About Me: </h2>

<p>My name is Dominic Varchetto and I am from Burr Ridge, IL. I have two siblings, a sister and 
a younger brother. I am currently studying Aviation here at Lewis and plan on minoring in Business
as well. </p>

    <h2>  What I hope to learn in this course... </h2>
   <p> - How to code and build a complete website. <br>
        - Learn the different programming languages. <br>
        - Becoming familiar with the language. <br>

        - Learning the different definitions and terms. </p>
    
    I'm confident that I will be able to do all of these things once the semester ends and I'm 
    excited to see what is in store!
